//! Background job worker — polls `rapina_jobs`, claims work, and dispatches
//! to registered handlers.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! Jobs move through three states in normal execution:
//!
//! ```text
//! pending → running → completed
//!                   ↘ failed   (or back to pending if retries remain)
//! ```
//!
//! The worker atomically transitions each job from `pending` to `running`
//! using backend-specific claiming strategies:
//!
//! - **PostgreSQL:** CTE + `UPDATE … FROM` + `RETURNING` + `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
//! - **MySQL 8.0+:** transaction with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, then `UPDATE`
//! - **SQLite 3.35+:** `UPDATE … WHERE id IN (subquery) … RETURNING`
//!
//! # Crash recovery
//!
//! Jobs left `running` by a dead worker are reaped on the poll cycle after
//! their lease expires and rejoin the queue under the same retry budget as
//! failures. A panicking handler does not stop the worker: the panic is
//! caught, logged at `error` level, and routed through the same retry path.
//!
//! # Graceful shutdown
//!
//! The worker installs its own SIGINT/SIGTERM listeners (identical to
//! `server.rs`). When a signal fires the poll loop exits after the
//! **current batch** finishes — no job is abandoned mid-execution.
//!
//! # Trace propagation
//!
//! When a job row has a `trace_id`, the worker opens a tracing span that
//! includes the original value so all log lines emitted during the job share
//! the same trace identifier as the HTTP request that enqueued it.
